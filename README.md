## Applied Data Mining
### Final Project by Ailene Torres

Every year, the Department of Education releases a Quality Report on how schools are performing. Based on various determinants, ratings are given to schools for different catergories. One of these categories is the student achievement rating which is based on student academic performance. Schools are given a rating from four options: Not Meeting Target, Approaching Target, Meeting Target, and Exceeding Target. By using quality report and exam result data sets, we were able to conclude that there is no one specific feature that influences a school's student achievement rating.
